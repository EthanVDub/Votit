# votit
A platform for voting and polling on current affairs, sports, opinions, etc.

The goal of this project is to create a site (and potential app) for voting in polls and predicting
other's results. It will hopefully include featured/popular polls, ability to create public and private polls (private polls
would act similar to a platform like strawpoll), and even a virtual currency used for casual betting on polling results. 

This is supposed to be structured similar to the Wii Channel "Everybody Votes" where you'd not only repond
to popular polls but predict how others will respond. You will also have the ability to see how the poll faired across
different states, countries, ages and more.

The app will need to track *basic* user information and have user sign up and sign in. 

The whole thing will be done in React.
